# Function Generator for 8051 Microcontroller

## Overview
This project contains assembly code for the 8051 microcontroller to act as a function generator capable of creating the following signals:
- Square wave
- Sawtooth wave
- Sine wave

The frequency of these signals can be adjusted from 2kHz to 10kHz, with the square wave capable of reaching up to 50kHz.

## Features
- **Frequency Adjustment**: Users can modify the signal frequency within the specified range.
- **Signal Variety**: Generates three different types of waveforms.
- **High-Frequency Range**: Square wave generation up to 50kHz.

## Applications
This project can be used to learn about:
- Keypad interface with microcontrollers.
- LCD interface and operations.
- Digital to Analog Converters (DAC).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the assembly code in an appropriate IDE or text editor.
3. Assemble and upload the code to the 8051 microcontroller.
4. Connect the microcontroller to a waveform viewer to see the output.
