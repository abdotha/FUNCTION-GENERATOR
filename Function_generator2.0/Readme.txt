# 8051 Function Generator Project

This project implements a function generator using an 8051 microcontroller. The function generator can produce three types of signals: square wave, sawtooth wave, and sine wave. Additionally, it allows the user to adjust the frequency of the generated signals within a certain range.

## Features

- Generates square wave, sawtooth wave, and sine wave signals.
- Adjustable frequency range from 2 kHz to 10 kHz.
- Square wave signal can exceed the range up to 50 kHz.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning tool for understanding various concepts related to microcontroller programming and interfacing, including:

- **Keypad Interface**: The project demonstrates how to interface a keypad with the 8051 microcontroller to allow user input for selecting signal type and adjusting frequency.
  
- **LCD Interface**: An LCD is used to display the selected signal type and the current frequency setting. This helps in understanding how to interface and control an LCD display with the 8051 microcontroller.
  
- **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**: The project utilizes DAC functionality to convert digital signals generated by the microcontroller into analog signals for output. This provides insight into the operation and usage of DACs in microcontroller projects.

## Usage

To use the function generator:

1. Connect the 8051 microcontroller board to the required peripherals, including keypad, LCD display, and DAC.
   
2. Power on the microcontroller board.

3. Use the keypad to select the desired signal type (square wave, sawtooth wave, or sine wave) and adjust the frequency settings as needed.

4. Monitor the LCD display to view the selected signal type and frequency settings.

5. Connect an oscilloscope or other measuring device to the output pins of the microcontroller to observe the generated signals.
